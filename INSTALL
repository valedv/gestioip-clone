GestioIP 2.2 IPAM
IP address management software


INSTALLATION GestioIP 2.2
=========================


GestioIP is a web based IP network and IP address
management (IPAM) tool. See the README file for more details.


Requirements
============

Apache2 with mod_perl, Mysql5.x, Perl, some Perl modules


Installation
=============

The installation of GestioIP consists of two parts.
A command line part to install the required perl modules
and to configure the apache web server and a web-based
part to create and configure the mysql database.

If there are Perl Modules missing Setup will offer the
option to install them automatically with the Linux distribution
specific packet managers (yum, zypper, apt-get). But there are not
all Perl Modules like packages for all distributions available.
Setup offers the possibility to automatically download (from CPAN)
and intall the missing Modules. That requires wget and make to be
installed during the installation.

VLAN discovery and parts of host discovery are partly based 
on the Perl Module SNMP::INFO. This requires that Netdisco's MIB
files are installed on the system. Setup offers the option to
automatically download and install requiered MIB files.

Note for Fedora/Redhat/CentOS
Default SELinux setting impede to execute web based part of installation
and the execution of GestioIP. Setup offers the option to update SELinux
policy automatically. See online documentation page for details.
