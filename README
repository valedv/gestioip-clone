GestioIP 2.2 IPAM README
========================

GestioIP is a web based IP address management (IPAM) tool.
It's designed to quickly find the information that administrators
frequently need. GestioIP features a front page with integrated search

    * The IP address of the switch in the 3. floor of site Y
    * The IP address of the TFTP server in the pre-production
    * All IP addresses of router xy and to which networks they are
      connected
