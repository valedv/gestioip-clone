GestioIP 2.2 IPAM
IP address management software


UPDATE FROM GestioIP IPAM 2.2.x
==========================

GestioIP 2.2.8 requires additional Perl Modules (Net::DNS and
and SNMP::INFO). Update script offers the option to install
the modules automatically with the Linux distribution specific
packet managers (yum, zypper, apt-get) in the case they are available.
If the packages are not available, update offers the possibility
to automatically download (from CPAN) and install the missing Modules.
That requires wget and make to be installed during the update.

VLAN discovery and parts of host discovery are partly based 
on the Perl Module SNMP::INFO. This requires that Netdisco's MIB
files are installed on the system. Setup offers the option to
automatically download and install required MIB files.


IMPORTANT NOTE
Script for automatic actualization of old version are not compatible
with v2.2.8. Disable all cronjobs for automatic actualization
before updating to v2.2.8. You will find the new scripts for 
automatic actualization in /usr/share/gestioip/bin and configuration
for automatic actualization in /usr/share/gestioip/etc. You need to
update crontab manually with the new scripts.
