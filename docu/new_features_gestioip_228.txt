This is a provisional short info about new features of GestioIP v2.2.8

Official documentation will be published as soon as possible

Barcelona, 13/01/2011




(1) DISCOVERY

Network discovery is convinced to explore the network infrastructure using SNMP and DNS and to import the found information into GestioIP's database

It executes the following processes:

1 VLAN discovery via SNMP using Perl Modul SNMP::Info
2 Network discovery via SNMP querying routing tables from network devices
3 Host discovery of new found networks via SNMP using SNMP::Info and own discovery mechanisms
4 Host discovery of new found networks via DNS

Please read Quick Start Guide before executing discovery.


(2) VLAN MANAGEMENT

The VLAN management gives an overview of existing VLANs and disposes of an automatic VLAN discovery mechanism.

Vlan discovery
To access VLAN importation form go to "import/export" -> "import VLANs via SNMP".

node: introduce here an IP address of a device with VLAN information
layer II devices: To import VLANs form devices classified with host type "L2 device"
layer III devices: To import VLANs from devices classified with host type "L3 device"

NOTE
If you doesn't have devices classified with host type L2 or L3 device there appear the note "No layer II devices defined"
To change the host type of a device go to "show networks", access to the corresponding network and click device "edit host" button.

NOTE
Column "switches" of VLAN overview will only be updated when discovery is lanced against a device from Layer II or Layer III devices select box.


The VLAN menu offers the following functions

* show - to access VLAN overview
* new - to create new VLANs manually
* unify - VLAN names are configured manually by network administrators. This may cause that the same VLAN appears in different devices with different names (e.g. VLAN 1 may have name "DEFAULT" on one device and "default_vlan" on another). "Unify" is intended to associate this kind of VLANs so that the appear like one in GestioIPs VLAN overview
* show/new vlan provider - You may have contracted VLANs with different Internet Providers. You can specify them here.


(3) COLUMNS

You can now define new columns which will shown in network or host list view.
There are two types of columns: Predefined and custom columns.
Predefined columns will be updated by SNMP discovery mechanisms, custom columns not.

Go to "manage" -> "custom columns" to define new columns.

NOTE
Predefined network column "VLAN" will not be updated by VLAN discovery.


(4) CLIENTS

With clients feature it's possible to manage different address ranges completely independently. 

Go to "manage" -> "clients" to show, add, edit or delete clients.
